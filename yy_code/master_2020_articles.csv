For translation to such applications, these devices must first demonstrate robust performance with high transfer efficiencies over extended distances. Here, we report the optimization of FRET in a 6-helix DNA origami architecture supporting a 14-dye site system that contains a central 10-dye homogeneous FRET (HomoFRET) relay span and overall extends over 29 nm in length. Varying the dye density by controlling their presence or absence across all of the individually addressable sites presented an incredibly large optimization space (1024 HomoFRET and 16 384 total permutations). High-throughput experiments, with over 500 measurements of DNA templates assembled in parallel, allowed for the study of HomoFRET transfer as a function of fluorophore density and arrangement. Transfer within solution-phase MPWs initially obtained with steady-state spectroscopy experiments revealed values only reaching -1% efficiency. Extensive photophysical characterization, utilizing six different spectroscopic techniques and 11 total methodologies, determined that the diminished FRET efficiency of each individual component step is the principal cause of the limited transfer in solution. Monte Carlo and machine-learning methods provided additional insights into design optimization. A representative MPW set selected based on the previous findings was subsequently characterized in film deposition and also under cryogenic conditions. Under these improved conditions, selected MPWs demonstrated 59 +/- 6% energy transport efficiency over a length of 29 nm; this is similar to 25% longer and 10-fold more efficient than the previously reported optimized DNA MPWs."

Unbeknownst to the users, with the adoption of these ""smart home"" technologies, their personal space becomes vulnerable to security and privacy attacks. We conducted studies of vulnerabilities and security posture of smart home IoT devices. We started with a literature review on known vulnerability studies of the IoT devices, considering four categories of attacks: 1) physical; 2) network; 3) software; and 4) encryption. We then conducted our own vulnerability experiments that compared security postures between well known and lesser known vendors through misuse and abuse case analysis, followed by a review of coverage in major vulnerability databases. Based on our analysis, the main finding was the need for a stronger focus on the security posture of lesser known vendor devices as they are often less regulated and faceless scrutiny."

Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research."

IoT technologies and the data driven services they offer were beyond imagination just a decade ago. Now, they surround us and influence a variety of domains such as automobile, smart home, healthcare, etc. In particular, the Agriculture and Farming industries have also embraced this technological intervention. Smart devices are widely used by a range of people from farmers to entrepreneurs. These technologies are used in a variety of ways, from finding real-time status of crops and soil moisture content to deploying drones to assist with tasks such as applying pesticide spray. However, the use of IoT and smart communication technologies introduce a vast exposure to cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in smart farming environments. Such cyber attacks have the potential to disrupt the economies of countries that are widely dependent on agriculture. In this paper, we present a holistic study on security and privacy in a smart farming ecosystem. The paper outlines a multi layered architecture relevant to the precision agriculture domain and discusses the security and privacy issues in this dynamic and distributed cyber physical environment. Further more, the paper elaborates on potential cyber attack scenarios and highlights open research challenges and future directions."

For optimum resource utilization, wireless communication systems require knowledge of the prevalent situation in a frequency band through learning. To learn appropriately, it is imperative for practitioners to select the right parameters for building robust data-driven learning models as well as use the appropriate algorithms and performance evaluation methods. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of deep learning models against the performance of other machine learning methods for wireless communication systems. We explore the different wireless communication scenarios in which deep learning can be used given Radio Frequency (RF) data, and evaluate its performance in various scenarios. Furthermore, we express it as a distribution alignment problem in which deep learning models do not perform well when learning from RF data of a particular distribution and evaluating on RF data from a different distribution. We also discuss our results in the light of how signal quality affects deep learning model leveraging on the knowledge from computer vision domain. The effect of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) selection for training on the model performance as it relates to practical implementation of deep learning in communications systems is also discussed. From our analysis, we conclude that the design and use of RF spectrum learning must be tailored to each specific scenario being considered in practice."

Any piece of information can be spread rapidly across the globe at lightning speed. The biggest challenge for social media platforms like Twitter is how to trust news shared on them when there is no systematic news verification process, which is the case for traditional media. Detecting false information, for example, detection of rumors is a non-trivial task, given the fast-paced social media environment. In this work, we proposed an ensemble model, which performs majority-voting scheme on a collection of predictions of neural networks using time-series vector representation of Twitter data for fast detection of rumors. Experimental results show that proposed neural network models outperformed classical machine learning models in terms of micro F1 score. When compared to our previous works the improvements are 12.5% and 7.9%, respectively."

It obtains the capability of retrieving the information even the packets collide by training a deep neural network offline with the historical radio frequency (RF) traces and inferring the STAs involved collisions online in near-real-time. Specifically, we propose a MAC protocol based on intelligent spectrum learning for the future wireless local area networks (WLANs), called SL-MAC. In the proposed MAC, an access point (AP) is installed with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model to identify the stations (STAs) involved in the collisions. In contrast to the conventional contention-based random medium access methods, e.g., IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF), the proposed SL-MAC protocol seeks to schedule data transmissions from the STAs suffering from the collisions. To achieve this goal, we develop a two-step offline training algorithm enabling the AP to sense the spectrum with the aid of the CNN. In particular, on receiving the overlapped signal(s), the AP firstly predicts the number of STAs involving collisions and then further identifies the STAs & x2019; ID. Furthermore, we analyze the upper bound of throughput gain brought by the CNN predictor and investigate the impact of the inference error on the achieved throughput. Extensive simulations show the superiority of the proposed SL-MAC and allow us to gain insights on the trade-off between performance gain and the inference accuracy."

CAD systems can be used for the detection and diagnosis of breast tumors as a ""second opinion"" review complementing the radiologist's review. CAD systems have many common parts, such as image preprocessing, tumor feature extraction, and data classification that are mostly based on machine-learning (ML) techniques. In this review article, we describe applications of ML-based CAD systems in MRI covering the detection of diagnostically challenging lesions of the breast such as nonmass enhancing (NME) lesions, and furthermore discuss how multiparametric MRI and radiomics can be applied to the study of NME, including prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Since ML has been widely used in the medical imaging community, we provide an overview about the state-of-the-art and novel techniques applied as classifiers to CAD systems. The differences in the CAD systems in MRI of the breast for several standard and novel applications for NME are explained in detail to provide important examples, illustrating: 1) CAD for detection and diagnosis, 2) CAD in multiparametric imaging, 3) CAD in NAC, and 4) breast cancer radiomics. We aim to provide a comparison between these CAD applications and to illustrate a global view on intelligent CAD systems based on machine and deep learning in MRI of the breast.

Thus, it is very useful to know how the different components are arranged on the surface of catalysts to gain a fundamental understanding of the catalysis occurring on bimetallic surfaces. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations can provide deeper insight into the surface segregation behavior and help understand the surface composition on bimetallic surfaces. However, the DFT calculations are computationally demanding and require large computing platforms. In this regard, statistical/machine learning methods provide a quick and alternative approach to study materials properties. Here, we trained previously reported surface segregation energies on low index surfaces of bimetallic catalysts using various linear and non-linear statistical methods to find a correlation between surface segregation energies and elemental properties. The results revealed that the surface segregation energies on low index bimetallic surfaces can be predicted using fundamental elemental properties."

Significant progress has been made in the application of effective machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and prediction of human activities in smart environments, such as ambient assisted living, healthcare monitoring, surveillance-based security and fitness tracking. In this paper, we propose to apply a supervised learning algorithm called margin setting algorithm (MSA) to predict the human activities. To validate the performance of MSA, we compare it with the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) and understand the activities of daily living of two residents in a smart home. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms."
